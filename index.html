        <h1>About seals</h1>
       <p> Pinnipeds commonly known as seals are diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic, mostly marine mammals. There are 34 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct have been discovered from fossils. Seals range in size from 1m and 45kg to 5m and 3 200 kg.</p><p>

        Seals have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are shaped like flippers. Though not as fast in the water as dolphins, seals are more flexible and agile.

        </p>
        <p>
          The eyes of pinnipeds are relatively large for their size and are positioned near the front of the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. On land, pinnipeds are near-sighted in dim light. This is reduced in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light.
